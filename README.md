# JavaScript-Dice-Game
This is Two-Dice Pig Game. The Rules are as follows.

Two standard dice are rolled. If neither shows a 1, their sum is added to the turn total.
If a single 1 is rolled, the player scores nothing and the turn ends.
If two 1s are rolled, the playerâ€™s entire score is lost, and the turn ends.
If a double is rolled, the point total is added to the turn total as with any roll but the player is obligated to roll again (possible sub-variation of the two-dice game).


Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":

If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
